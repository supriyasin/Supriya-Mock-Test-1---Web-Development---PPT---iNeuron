    "#1. Explain all the CSS positions(static, fixed, sticky, relative, absolute) with one code example each \n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Sure! Here are the explanations of the different CSS positions along with one code example for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Static:\n",
    "      The static position is the default position for all elements. Elements with a static position are positioned \n",
    "      based on the normal document flow. They are not affected by the top, bottom, left, or right properties.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   <div class=\"static-position\">\n",
    "    This is a div with static position.\n",
    "  </div>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  .static-position {\n",
    "  position: static;\n",
    "  width: 200px;\n",
    "  height: 100px;\n",
    "  background-color: red;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Relative:\n",
    "      Elements with a relative position are positioned relative to their normal position in the document flow. \n",
    "      You can use the top, bottom, left, and right properties to adjust the position relative to where it would normally be.\n",
    "      \n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  <div class=\"relative-position\">\n",
    "    This is a div with relative position.\n",
    "  </div>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  .relative-position {\n",
    "  position: relative;\n",
    "  width: 200px;\n",
    "  height: 100px;\n",
    "  background-color: blue;\n",
    "  top: 20px;\n",
    "  left: 50px;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. Absolute:\n",
    "      Elements with an absolute position are positioned relative to their nearest positioned ancestor \n",
    "      (an ancestor that has a position value other than static). If there is no positioned ancestor, \n",
    "      then the element is positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the viewport).\n",
    "      \n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  <div class=\"parent\">\n",
    "  <div class=\"absolute-position\">\n",
    "    This is a div with absolute position.\n",
    "  </div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  .parent {\n",
    "  position: relative;\n",
    "  width: 400px;\n",
    "  height: 200px;\n",
    "  background-color: yellow;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    ".absolute-position {\n",
    "  position: absolute;\n",
    "  width: 200px;\n",
    "  height: 100px;\n",
    "  background-color: green;\n",
    "  top: 50px;\n",
    "  left: 50px;\n",
    "}\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "   4. Fixed:\n",
    "      Elements with a fixed position are positioned relative to the viewport, meaning they stay in the same \n",
    "      position even if the page is scrolled. Fixed elements are commonly used for headers or navigation bars.\n",
    "      \n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  <div class=\"fixed-position\">\n",
    "  This is a div with fixed position.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  .fixed-position {\n",
    "  position: fixed;\n",
    "  width: 200px;\n",
    "  height: 100px;\n",
    "  background-color: orange;\n",
    "  top: 20px;\n",
    "  right: 20px;\n",
    "}\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  5. Sticky:\n",
    "     Elements with a sticky position are positioned based on the user's scroll position. They act like relative \n",
    "     positioning until a specific threshold is reached, and then they become fixed positioning and remain fixed \n",
    "     in that position.\n",
    "     \n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  <div class=\"sticky-position\">\n",
    "  This is a div with sticky position.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "  .sticky-position {\n",
    "  position: sticky;\n",
    "  width: 200px;\n",
    "  height: 100px;\n",
    "  background-color: purple;\n",
    "  top: 20px;\n",
    "}\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  These examples demonstrate the basic usage of each position value in CSS. You can further customize and adjust \n",
    "  the positions according to your needs by modifying the properties and values mentioned in the code snippets.\"\"\""
